# The Road not Taken(Original):

The Road Not Taken
By Robert Frost

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.

# The Wanderer

The Wanderer

Beneath a sky of endless gray,
Where shadows stretch and dreams decay,
A wanderer walks, alone and still,
Through forests bent to twilight's will.

The wind, a whisper soft and cold,
Sings stories ancient, yet untold.
Of mountains tall and oceans deep,
Of secrets time will never keep.

His steps are faint, his path unknown,
A soul that’s shaped by lands he's sown.
No home to hold, no name to claim,
But stars that guide him just the same.

In every dawn, a hope reborn,
In every dusk, a heart once torn.
The wanderer knows — the journey’s end,
Is not the road, but where you mend.

# The Road not Taken(Paraphrase):

The Road Not Taken
Robert Frost
Two roads diverged in a yellow forest.
I was sorry I could not travel both and become one traveler. 
I stopped for a long time, looking down one road as far as I could, until it turned in the undergrowth.
Then I took the other, equally beautiful, and perhaps better suited.
For it was overgrown and seldom walked on.
Yet both were equally worn with every passing by.
And that morning both were equally covered with leaves, and black, untouched by anyone.
Ah, I would save the first road for another day!
But I knew the road led to the road, and I wondered whether I could return. He sighs as he speaks.
Somewhere many years later:
Two roads diverged in a forest and I
I took the one least traveled by.
And that was very important.

# I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud(Original)

I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud
By William Wordsworth (1807)

I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

The waves beside them danced; but they
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
A poet could not but be gay,
In such a jocund company:
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.

# YOLO Abstract(original):

We present YOLO, a new approach to object detection. Prior work onobject detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection. 
Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. 
A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. 
Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance.

Figure 1: The YOLO Detection System. Processing images with YOLO is simple and straightforward.
Our system (1) resizes the input image to 448 × 448, (2) runs a single convolutional network on the image, and (3) thresholds the resulting detections
by the model’s confidence. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second.
A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors.
Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is less likely to predict false positives on background.
Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN,
when generalizing from natural images to other domains like artwork.

# YOLO Abtract(AI):

Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, essential for applications ranging from autonomous driving to real-time video analysis. 
Traditional approaches often involve complex pipelines that separate region proposal generation, feature extraction, and classification, 
leading to inefficiencies in speed and accuracy. In this work, we introduce YOLO (You Only Look Once), a unified framework for real-time object detection. 
Unlike traditional methods, YOLO directly predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities from full images in a single network pass, 
achieving both simplicity and high performance. Our approach significantly improves inference speed, allowing real-time processing at 45 frames per second 
on a standard GPU while maintaining competitive accuracy. Experiments on the PASCAL VOC dataset demonstrate YOLO's ability to generalize across 
diverse object categories and detect objects in complex scenes with fewer false positives. By reframing object detection as 
a single regression problem, YOLO sets a new benchmark for efficiency and real-world applicability in object detection.

# Excerpt from Newton, Laws of Motion(original):

Law I: Every body persists in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a straight line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed upon it.

Law II: The change of motion is proportional to the motive force impressed and takes place along the straight line in which that force is impressed.

Law III: To every action, there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal and directed to contrary parts.

# Excerpt from Newton, Laws of Motion(AI):

Law I: An object will remain at rest or continue to move in a straight line at a constant speed unless acted upon by an external force.

Law II: The rate of change of an object’s motion (its acceleration) is directly proportional to the force applied to it and occurs in the same direction as the applied force.

Law III: For every force exerted by one object on another, there is an equal and opposite force exerted by the second object on the first.

# Excerpt from Newton, Laws of Motion(paraphrase):

Law I: Objects continue to move straight at rest or at a constant speed, unless they act depending on the external force.

Legal II: The movement rate (acceleration) of the object movement is directly proportional to the applicable force and occurs in the same direction as applied. 

Law III: For every force exerted by one object on another, there is an equal and opposite force exerted by the second object on the first.

# The Master of Mankind by Aaron Dembski-Bowden, Chapter 3 First Page(Original):

Diocletian Coros stood upon the wall of a fortress that shouldn’t exist,
bathed in a halo of unwanted sunlight. While the first natural light to grace his
skin in over five years should have been a blessing, he found himself pained
by its unwelcome glare. His eyes were far too used to the sunless, skyless
half-light of the realm below the Palace.
He wore weariness as a cloak, dulling his senses and pulling at his limbs.
Exhaustion burned off him in an aura. The battle was over for now, yet still it
leeched his strength. This weakness was new to him. He found that he
loathed it.
Here on the high walls, Diocletian scarcely recognised his surroundings.
The curving, graceful spires of the Palace’s Ennara Towers were gone,
replaced by a grey bastion of rockcrete and plasteel. Its minarets, once things
of such stark wonder that pilgrims had been speechless upon seeing them,
were ground down into rigid, armoured gun towers with rows of turrets and
laser batteries aiming up at the sky. Crews of maintenance servitors, antsmall
at this distance, worked under the guidance of robed tech-priests.

# The Master of Mankind by Aaron Dembski-Bowden, Chapter 3 First Page(AI):

Diocletian Coros stood atop the ramparts of a fortress that defied reason, bathed in an intrusive flood of sunlight. 
After five long years without the touch of natural light, what should have been a gift felt like a curse. 
The brightness pierced his eyes, unkind to those accustomed to the dim, unchanging glow of the Palace’s subterranean depths.
Fatigue hung heavy on him, like a weathered cloak clinging to his frame. Every movement felt sluggish, his body weighed down by the lingering toll of recent battles. 
Though the conflict had subsided for now, its aftershocks still sapped his strength. This unfamiliar frailty unsettled him; he despised it.
From this vantage point, the world around him felt alien. The familiar elegance of the Ennara Towers, once awe-inspiring with their 
sweeping curves and gleaming spires, had vanished. In their place loomed a grim fortress of rockcrete and plasteel. Minarets, once revered by pilgrims 
for their ethereal beauty, had been transformed into harsh gun towers bristling with turrets and laser cannons aimed skyward. Far below, 
swarms of servitors toiled under the direction of tech-priests, their movements precise and methodical, but devoid of life.

Diocletian could barely discern his surroundings.
Gone was the graceful, curved spire of his palace's Tower of Ennara,

# Tränen-Bringer by Veit Etzold, Chapter 7 Book 2, first Page(Original):

Kottbusser Tor, dachte er, als sein Blick den beiden jüngeren Damen folgte, die mit zwei Rucksäcken Richtung Eingangstür gingen. 
Die Eingangstür der Wohnung, die er kannte. In diesem riesigen Wohnblock, den er kannte.
Und den die beiden Mädchen, die er sah, noch nicht kannten.
Kottbusser Tor.
Kotti, wie man ihn liebevoll nannte.
Liebevoll benannte man etwas nur, wenn man es eigentlich nicht mochte, fand er.
Und er mochte den Kotti nicht.
Nordafrikaner, Osteuropäer und Tschetschenen starrten ihn misstrauisch an.

Kottbusser Tor, he thought, as his eyes trailed the two younger women heading toward the entrance door. 
The door to the apartment he knew. In the massive housing block he knew all too well.
The block that these two girls, who he now watched, were about to enter for the first time.
Kottbusser Tor.
Kotti, as people affectionately called it.
But affection was a lie, he thought. You only used a fond nickname for something you didn’t truly like. And he didn’t like Kotti.
North Africans, Eastern Europeans, and Chechens met his gaze with wary, untrusting stares.

To the place they found

Dark sun
Hollowed by the fate
Our debt
They left to be paid
See the blackness stare
Promising to spare
The chosen

[Chorus]
Born of graves and left below
Painted ashes, painted snow
When the Dark awakens
Fires of our last hope are getting low

Souls of gods and Souls of Men
Meet in Cinders to ascend

I've a tale that time has lost
Scenes of judgement, born in frost
Then he took a name
For the one profaned

Know the dark and let it rest
Left to lurkers in their quest
Let the watchers fight
Let the Blood ignite
The chosen

[Chorus]
Born of graves and left below
Painted ashes, painted snow
When the Dark awakens
Fires of our last hope are getting low

Souls of gods and Souls of Men
Meet in Cinders to ascend

And our Fading Light is at its end

[Bridge]
Souls to revive us
Or rot us away
Want for the weary
And Death for the sane
Cursed yet we listen for bells left to toll
To fight back the depths
Of Humanity's soul
For the Unkindled
We look to the sun
Cities in gold
All the victories one
Fear not the dark
Nor the monsters my friend
And brace for the feast
Of Humanity's end

[Chorus] x2
Born of graves and left below
Painted ashes, painted snow
When the Dark awakens
Fires of our last hope are getting low

Souls of gods and Souls of Men
Meet in Cinders to ascend
Fate has chosen
And our Fading Light is at its end

# Song Lyrics from "Embers of the Fallen"(AI):

[Verse 1]
Silent echoes
In the halls of stone
Fallen heroes
On a path unknown
It’s a shadow’s game
Writ in ash and flame

Twilight’s whisper
Hides a dying vow
Ancient embers
Flicker, fading now
See the void descend
Calling to the end
The chosen

[Chorus]
Born of dusk, we rise and fall
Shattered dreams and broken thrall
When the light is dying
Voices of the lost answer the call

Kings of dust and Lords of pain
Falling stars and endless rain
Bound by sorrow
To the endless night, we rise again

[Verse 2]
I've a song of trials past
Written deep in echoes cast
Through the frozen halls
Hear the silence call

Rise in fear, the night will claim
Lost to time, forgotten name
Let the embers burn
Let the wheel now turn
The chosen

[Chorus]
Born of dusk, we rise and fall
Shattered dreams and broken thrall
When the light is dying
Voices of the lost answer the call

Kings of dust and Lords of pain
Falling stars and endless rain
Bound by sorrow
To the endless night, we rise again

[Bridge]
Winds of despair
Cry over the flame
Hope for the hollowed
And peace for the slain
Chains of the past
Keep pulling us low
The burden we carry
Is all that we know

For the lost kin
We tread through the mire
Cities in ruin
Their spires in fire
Fear not the dark
Nor the void it will send
For glory awaits
At the world’s bitter end

[Chorus] x2
Born of dusk, we rise and fall
Shattered dreams and broken thrall
When the light is dying
Voices of the lost answer the call

Kings of dust and Lords of pain
Falling stars and endless rain
Bound by sorrow
To the endless night, we rise again

[Outro]
To the endless night, we rise again
Fading stars will guide us then
